# RussianNumberGenerator
On macOS, generate mp3 files of numbers in Russian.

As Russian language learner, I developed this little application to read Russian numbers to a file so that I can include the audio on my Anki flashcards.

You simply set a location for the generated files, the beginning and ending number and choose whether to generate random or sequential numbers in a range.
